# ACCESS-OM3

ACCESS-OM3 is a global coupled ocean - sea ice - wave model being developed by [COSIMA](http://www.cosima.org.au) and [ACCESS-NRI](https://www.access-nri.org.au/). It consists of MOM6, CICE6 and (optionally) WaveWatch3, coupled with NUOPC and driven by prescribed surface forcing - see [here](https://access-om3-configs.access-hive.org.au/pages/Architecture/).

# Downloading

This repository only stores (no longer used!) model source code and is **deprecated**. **This repo is only useful to users wanting to browse *older* builds of ACCESS-OM3**.

Model configurations are available from branches in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs), which use pre-built executables available on [NCI](https://nci.org.au/). Whilst it is not needed to run the model, the newer build system uses Spack and is [here](https://github.com/aCCESS-NRI/acceSS-OM3). NCI-based users of ACCESS-OM3 typically won't need to download the build repository unless they need to make model component code changes.

# Documentation (including building and running the model)

See [access-om3-configs.access-hive.org.au](https://access-om3-configs.access-hive.org.au/), particularly the [quick start](https://access-om3-configs.access-hive.org.au/pages/Quick-start/).
